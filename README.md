**Solving sudoku as a constraint satisfactoon problem (CSP).** 

## Description
This repository is an exploration of various Backtracking algorithms and their performance which can be used for solving the classic [Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku) puzzle in python. The [sudoku_solver.py](https://github.com/fork52/Sudoku-Solver/blob/master/sudoku_solver.py) has several classes each employing a different strategy for solving the sudkou problem. You can also enjoy the visualization by running the [MAINMENU.py](https://github.com/fork52/Sudoku-Solver/blob/master/MAINMENU.py) file. The GUI has been built using python's inbuilt tkinter library.
